          This lens answers: <strong>“How does it behave internally?”</strong> Does it only react?
          Does it use memory? Can it model other minds?

              Uses past information (a short history) to make better decisions. Many modern systems
              fit here.

              The idea: the AI understands that other beings have thoughts, feelings, and intentions
              (like humans do). This is still research.

              A system that has a sense of “self” and internal experience. There’s no confirmed
              self-aware AI today.

          <strong>Reality check:</strong>
          When people say “AI is conscious”, they usually mean it talks well—not that it’s truly
          self-aware.

          <h2>Where do chatbots fit?</h2>
          <p>
            Many chatbots look like they “understand” you, but a lot of that is powerful pattern
            recognition on language.

            <strong>Good question to ask:</strong>
            Does it track context reliably? Does it know when it’s unsure? Can it check sources?

          <h2>Why this classification matters</h2>
          <p>
            It helps us avoid confusion:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>“Reactive” systems can be fast and reliable but not flexible.</li>
            <li>“Limited memory” systems can adapt but may have new failure modes.</li>
            <li>“Theory of mind / self-aware” claims should require strong evidence.</li>
